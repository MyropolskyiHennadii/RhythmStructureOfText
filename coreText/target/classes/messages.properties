web.commonTitle=Rhythm Structure of the Text
web.homeInstruction=Before you start you have to define whether your text is a poem or prose (checkbox = prose).\
\n\
\n\
Don't forget, please, to confirm your choice. If you are analyzing poems (not prose), you can omit this checkbox.\
\n\
\n\
You can insert your small text in the text field OR upload your txt-file.\
\n\
\n\
You can only use *.txt file, UTF-8, size < 2000Kb.\
\n\
\n\
In poems you also have to define the portions separator in your file and at the form (for ex. //////////)  while analyzing different poems in your file exactly as different ones (not as one long poem).\
\n\
\n\
For prose you don't need a separator. In case prose paragraphs bound portions. Sentences are the segments (like lines in poem).\
\n\
\n\
Sentences are recognized by punctuation (. ; ? and so on), there is no syntax analyzer.\
\n\
\n\
Don't use in the text which is being analyzed the poem titles (the numbers or titles of the chapters in prose) and so forth. You'll receive results as portions, numerated by your separators in poems or by the number of the paragraph in prose.\
\n\
\n\
In the analysis results symbol  '1' means the stressed syllable, symbol '0' - the unstressed syllable and space - the interval between words.\
\n\
\n\
While being during the process of analyzing your text, you can be asked by the system you about the stress-schema of unknown words, because it has in the dictionary not 'all' Russian words. \
\n\
\n\
In such cases you have to define the stresses schema for the unknown word. For example the Russian word 'корова' has the stress schema 010.\
\n\
\n\
The position of stress in Russian words (in particular, one syllable words) isn't always single-valued, that is why mistakes in common stress representation are inevitable. You ought to be careful with the machine's results.\
\n\
\n\
You may correct stress schema in lines/paragraphs and recalculate average characteristics of the whole text.
