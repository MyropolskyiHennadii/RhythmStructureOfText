web.commonTitle=Rhythm Structure of the Text
web.homeInstruction=Before you start you have to define wether your text is a poem or prose (checkbox = prose).\
\n\
\n\
Don't forget, please, submit your choice. If you have poems (not prose) you can omit this checkbox.\
\n\
\n\
You can enter your small text in text field OR upload your txt-file.\
\n\
\n\
You can use only *.txt file, UTF-8, size < 2000Kb.\
\n\
\n\
In poems you also have to define portions separator in your file and at the form (for ex. //////////)  to recognize during analysis different poems in your file exactly as different (not as one long poem).\
\n\
\n\
For prose you doesn't need separator. In case prose paragraphs bound portions. Sentences are the segments (like lines in poem).\
\n\
\n\
Sentences are recognized by punctuation (. ; ? and so on), there is no syntax analyzer.\
\n\
\n\
Don't use in text titles of poems (number or titles chapters in prose) and so on. You'll receive results as portions, numerated by your separators in poems or by number of paragraph in prose.\
\n\
\n\
In analysis relults symbol  '1' means syllable under the stress, symbol '0' - syllable without stress and space - interval between words.\
\n\
\n\
During analysis system can ask you about stress-schema of unknown words, because of it has in dictionary not 'all' Russian words with stresses. \
\n\
\n\
In such cases you have to define stresses schema for unknown word. For example Russian word 'корова' has stress schema 010.\
\n\
\n\
Position of stress in Russian words (for instance words with one syllable) isn't always single-valued, that is why mistakes in common stress representation are inevitable. Be careful with machine's results.\
\n\
\n\
You may correct stress schema in lines/paragraphs and recalculate average characteristics of whole text.
